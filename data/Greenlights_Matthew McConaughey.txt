My first twenty years were where I learned the value of values.
Through discipline and deep affection, I learned respect,
accountability, creativity, courage, perseverance, fairness, service,
good humor, and a spirit of adventure in ways that some people
might consider abusive, but I remember as tough love, and I
wouldn’t give back one ass whupping I ever got for the value of the
values my parents impressed upon me. I thank them for that.
My twenties and thirties were contradictory decades, years when
I eliminated conditions and truths that went against my grain. The
value in this conservative era was that it safeguarded me from fatal
character debits early in life. It was a time when I was often more
concerned with not running red lights than I was with investing in
the greenlights. I did what I wanted, I learned to live. I survived.
My forties were a much more affirming decade, years when I
started to play offense with truths I had learned and put them into
action. An era where I doubled down on what fed me. The value of
this liberal age was that it illuminated my most life-endorsing
character assets. It was a time when I not only cruised through
more greenlights because I had eliminated more red and yellow
ones, but a time when I created more greenlights to travel through.
A time when past reds and yellows finally turned green, as old
hardships revealed themselves as good fortune, a time when the
greenlights beamed brighter because I gave them more power to
shine. I did what I needed, I lived to learn. I thrived.
As I approach the next chapter of truths to cross, the only thing I
know for sure is that I will recalibrate again, and that my family will
be at the core when I do. As a father, I often contradict myself, and I
know I could do a better job of practicing what I preach, but I’ve
also learned that if the message is true, don’t forget it, and forgive
the messenger, even if he does.
