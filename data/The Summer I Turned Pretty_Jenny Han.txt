The first time I ever had my heart broken was at this house. I was twelve.
It was one of those really rare nights when the boys weren't all together--
Steven and Jeremiah went on an overnight fishing trip with some boys
they'd met at the arcade. Conrad said he didn't feel like going, and of course
I wasn't invited, so it was just me and him.
Well, not together, but in the same house.
I was reading a romance novel in my room with my feet on the wall
when Conrad walked by. He stopped and said, "Belly, what are you doing
tonight?"
I folded the cover of my book over quickly. "Nothing," I said. I tried to
keep my voice even, not too excited or eager. I had left my door open on
purpose, hoping he'd stop by.
"Want to go to the boardwalk with me?" he asked. He sounded casual,
almost too casual.
This was the moment I had been waiting for. This was it. I was finally
old enough. Some part of me knew it too, it was ready. I glanced over at
him, just as casual as he'd been. "Maybe. I have been craving a caramel
apple."
"I'll buy one for you," he offered. "Just hurry up and put some clothes on
and we'll go. Our moms are going to the movies; they'll drop us off on the
way."
I sat up and said, "Okay."
As soon as Conrad left, I closed my door and ran over to my mirror. I
took my hair out of its braids and brushed it. It was long that summer,
almost to my waist. Then I changed out of my bathing suit and put on white
shorts and my favorite gray shirt. My dad said it matched my eyes. I
smeared some strawberry frosting lip gloss on my lips and tucked the tube
into my pocket, for later. In case I needed to reapply.
In the car Susannah kept smiling at me in the rearview mirror. I gave her
a look like, Quit, please--but I wanted to smile back. Conrad wasn't paying
attention anyway. He was looking out the window the whole ride there.
